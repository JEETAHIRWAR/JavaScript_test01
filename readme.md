# Array Manipulation Tasks

This project includes various array manipulation tasks implemented in JavaScript. It covers tasks such as printing developers, adding data, removing admins, concatenating arrays, calculating average age, checking age above 25, finding unique professions, sorting by age, updating John's profession, and getting the count of different professions.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaScript_test01.git


2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to interact with the array manipulation tasks.

# Code Explanation
- Each array manipulation task is implemented in script.js. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

# Questions :

## Data Array

```javascript
const data = [
  { name: "john", age: 24, profession: "developer" },
  { name: "jane", age: 27, profession: "admin" },
];

```

## Tasks and Functions:

### *Q.1* Prints the names of developers in the console.
> Print Developers (**`PrintDeveloper`** function): Log all developers from the array to the console.

### *Q.2* Prompts the user for a name, age, and profession, then adds a new user to the data array.
> Add Data (**`addData`** function): Add a new data object to the array using details collected from a prompt.

### *Q.3* Removes users with the "admin" profession from the data array.
> Remove Admins (**`removeAdmin`** function): Extract and remove all admins from the array.

### *Q.4* Concatenates the data array with a dummy array.
> Concatenate Array (**`concatenateArray`** function): Combine two arrays (create a dummy array as an example) and log the result.

### *Q.5* Calculates and prints the average age of users in the data array.
> Average Age (**`averageAge`** function): Compute and log the average age of all people in the array.

### *Q.6* Prints users whose age is above 25.
> Age Check (**`checkAgeAbove25`** function): Validate if there's at least one person in the array who's older than 25.

### *Q.7* find and display unique professions in the data array
> Unique Professions (**`uniqueProfessions`** function): Log all distinct professions present in the array.

### *Q.8* Sorts users in the data array in ascending order based on age.
> Sort by Age (**`sortByAge`** function): Organize the array by age in ascending order.

### *Q.9* Updates John's profession to "manager" in the data array.
> Update Profession (**`updateJohnsProfession`** function): Adjust 'john's profession to 'manager'.

### *Q.10* Prints the count of developers and admins in the data array.
> Profession Count (**`getTotalProfessions`** function): Calculate and print the total number of developers and admins in the array.

<!-- ```js
NOTE - Do not use ChatGPT.

Getting Started:
extract the file
open in vscode
.
Once you have the code locally, create a new GitHub repository on your account.
Upload the downloaded code to your new repository.
Important: Ensure you have both index.html and script.js and readme.md in your new repository.








Instructions:
Do Not Modify 
index.html: All the required elements, including buttons, have already been set up for you. Each button is tied to a function in script.js, which you'll have to fill out.

Edit 
script.js Only: This is where you'll be implementing the logic for each task. The functions corresponding to the tasks are already declared. Each button in index.html is wired up to trigger the corresponding function in script.js when clicked.



Tasks and Functions:


Print Developers (`PrintDeveloper` function): Log all developers from the array to the console.

Add Data (`addData` function): Add a new data object to the array using details collected from a prompt.

Remove Admins (`removeAdmin` function): Extract and remove all admins from the array.

Concatenate Array (`concatenateArray` function): Combine two arrays (create a dummy array as an example) and log the result.

Average Age (`averageAge` function): Compute and log the average age of all people in the array.

Age Check (`checkAgeAbove25` function): Validate if there's at least one person in the array who's older than 25.

Unique Professions (`uniqueProfessions` function): Log all distinct professions present in the array.

Sort by Age (`sortByAge` function): Organize the array by age in ascending order.

Update Profession (`updateJohnsProfession` function): Adjust 'john's profession to 'manager'.

Profession Count (`getTotalProfessions` function): Calculate and print the total number of developers and admins in the array.
