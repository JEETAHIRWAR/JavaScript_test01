NOTE - Do not use ChatGPT.

Getting Started:
extract the file
open in vscode
.
Once you have the code locally, create a new GitHub repository on your account.
Upload the downloaded code to your new repository.
Important: Ensure you have both index.html and script.js and readme.md in your new repository.








Instructions:
Do Not Modify 
index.html: All the required elements, including buttons, have already been set up for you. Each button is tied to a function in script.js, which you'll have to fill out.

Edit 
script.js Only: This is where you'll be implementing the logic for each task. The functions corresponding to the tasks are already declared. Each button in index.html is wired up to trigger the corresponding function in script.js when clicked.

Print Developers (`PrintDeveloper` function): Log all developers from the array to the console.

Add Data (`addData` function): Add a new data object to the array using details collected from a prompt.
